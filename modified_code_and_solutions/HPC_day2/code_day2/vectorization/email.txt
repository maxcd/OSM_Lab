Hi Simon,
This should work, i used g++. For some reason i couldn’t vectorize one of the loops so i readjusted the main.cpp.

The results you should have are as follows:

Non-vectorized:  Both float and double should take the same time to run.
Vectorized: The double loop should be 2x faster than non-vec and the float should be 4x faster than non-vec.

For something non-vectorizable just throw and “if" in the loop...
